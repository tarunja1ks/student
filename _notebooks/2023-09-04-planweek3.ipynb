    "My partner and I have huge plans for this week involving the showcase. One thing we want to add to our website is an email classifier, which includes checking if emails or spam or not. I would also like to make a feature to add data to the trianing set to any people experiencing spam emails. Another thing, we wanted to do was make a subpage that could tell the weather for anywhere in the world at any current time."
