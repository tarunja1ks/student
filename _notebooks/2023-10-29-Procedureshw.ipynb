    "# Notes\n",
    "    -A procedure is a named group of programming instructions, which can have parameters and return values. In Python, procedures are referred to as functions or methods.\n",
    "    -Parameters are input values for a procedure, and arguments specify the values of the parameters when the procedure is called.\n",
    "    -When a procedure is called, it interrupts the sequential execution of statements and executes the statements within the procedure before returning control to the point immediately following the procedure call.\n",
    "    -Procedures allow you to reuse a set of instructions without rewriting them in your code.\n",
    "    -Procedures are an example of abstraction, specifically procedural abstraction.\n",
    "    -Abstraction allows you to call a procedure without knowing how it works, making it easier to solve complex problems based on smaller sub-problems.\n",
    "    Procedures help simplify code and improve readability by breaking it into smaller, reusable parts.  \n"
