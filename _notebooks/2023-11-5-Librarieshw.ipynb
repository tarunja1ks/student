Research 3 different libraries in python. Explain their purpose as well as two of your favorite variables/functions in each. Type out your response.\n",

With this you will be able to make chatbots on your personal website that can assist a user. For example, in a website that sells merch you can add the chatgpt bot that can assist the user if they have trouble with something such as quality of the merch material. \n"
