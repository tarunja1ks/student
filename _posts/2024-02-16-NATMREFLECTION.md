## GLOW and GROWS
- Reflection glows and grows from the demo
### GROW
- One piece of grow we recieved from some CSA students is to add more features for the customizalibility of the buttons to make it a better site overall and to also better the SASS and design elements to make it look much better. They also said to make a feature where you can change the shape of the button to for example a circle or another shape. 
- Another grow they told us to add was the ability to change the user profile in a much simpler format and to make it more simlar to an actual website where the button to change the user is integrated into the user profile picture
 - Some CSA students and parents that visited our booth gave similar feedback which said that they liked the potential of the website and the advanced login systems with options ot change User profile pictures and other information and also the Design and how you are able to customize your own design and save it to the database and create designs as public and private
### Glow
- they also liked our search function feature and the heavy backend that was implemeneted
- They liked the animation feature and thought it was a cool finishing touch
- They thought the frontend of the homepage was clean and professional

## PERSONAL FEEDBACK
- from feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project
- I personally should try to integrate more backend features that will allow the project to change other information such as an About Me or other user-profile related information

## Here are some of the pictures of the people we talked to about our project
