## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 
- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

Some things I like to do for fun include coding, basketball, and more. I enjoy play basketball in my backyard or friends in the park. I cannot dunk like in the picture yet, but I hope to do so in the future. I also have some experience in coding competitvely in hackathons and competitive programing competitions. I code mainly in Python and Java. I also like to eat ice cream, which is in my freeform picture.
